## React Hooka :

- React hooks are functions that lets you use state and other features of react components.
- They enable you to manage state and handle side-effects.

```js
function evenOdd (num) {
    if(num % 2 !== 0) {
        return "odd";
     } else {
        return "even";
     }
}
evenOdd(5); // call
```

- Hooks are functions that start with `use` keyword.
- `useState` is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components.
